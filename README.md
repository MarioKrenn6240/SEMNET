We show an implementation in MATLAB and in python for creating a semantic network from data, and making predictions into the future.

## CreateAndAnalyseSEMNET
Contains a simple example, how to start from APS and arXiv files to create a Semantic Networks, calculate network theoretic properties, and make predictions

## PersonalizedSuggestions

Shows how to make personalized surprising predictions from personal papers, SemNet and the neural network predictions

## FullSemNet
Full concept list with 6372 entries, and the Semantic Network which is 6372x6372 entries with time information about concept emergence and connection emergence
